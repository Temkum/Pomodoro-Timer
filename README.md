# Pomodoro TImer
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/880/1*usZAFrV70goblyvT6zfFcA.jpeg)

I completed this project as part of the freeCodeCamp Front End Development Certificate. 

I had to fulfil the following user stories:

* I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.
* I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.
* I can customise the length of each pomodor]o.

You can view the project live [here](https://codepen.io/cynthiaLixinLee/pen/xWzdRK). I also wrote about my code refactoring process in a Medium article title [How I built my Pomodoro Clock app, and the lessons I learned along the way](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-built-my-pomodoro-clock-app-and-the-lessons-i-learned-along-the-way-51288983f5ee).
