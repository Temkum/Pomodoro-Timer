# Pomodoro App

Completed this project as a demo for Learning Dollars and part of the freeCodeCamp Front End Development Certificate. 

I had to fulfil the following user stories:

* I can start a 30 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 30 minutes has elapsed.
* I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.
* I can customize the length of each pomodoro.
